⚠️This repo is no longer in use and is archived for reference only. I have since migrated to new hardware with an overhauled setup, but many of the configurations are still valid.
-
### Overview

- Includes docker-compose files and scripts to configure services on my home server. 

- Containers are started and kept up-to-date with [Docker Compose v2](https://github.com/docker/compose). 

- [Diun](https://github.com/crazy-max/diun) is used for update notifications with Discord integration.

- My preferred images are from [linuxserver](https://www.linuxserver.io/) or [hotio](https://hotio.dev/) where possible, otherwise official images from app creators.

- Sensitive information from .env files are populated with variable substitution in compose files.

- [SWAG](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-swag) reverse proxy is used to expose selected services.
